# Visual search with distractor cueing

In this study, we adopt an additional singleton search task to investigate inhibitory cueing effect. 
In the task, participants are required to search for a dimaond shape target among distractors, and identify 
the orientation of a line inside the dimaond, if it is horizontal or vertical. In some trials, a singleton color distractor may appear. 

Before the search, a line cue is presented pointing to a distractor with a predefined probability, and participants were instructed to ignore this cue. After the search display appears, participants are asked to response as faster as possible, and as accurately as possible.

## Input parameters

When the first dialog box appears, you can set the following parameters:

- partcipant ID: a string of characters, e.g. "sub001"
- session: an integer, e.g. 1
- distractor prevalence: e.g., 0.9 (the probability of a color distractor appearing)
- cue validity: e.g., 0.9 (the probability of the cue pointing to the color distractor)
